        <h2>The Writing on the Wall</h2>
        
       <p>
            Across a painted desert lies a train of vagabonds <br>
            All that's left of what we were, it's what we have become<br>
            Once our empires glorious but now the empire's gone<br>
            The dead gave us the time to live and now our time is done<br>
            Now we are victorious, we've become our slaves<br>
            A land of hope and glory, building graveyards for the brave<br>

            Have you seen the writing on the wall?<br>
            Have you seen that writing?<br>

            Can you see them riding?<br>
            Can you see them riding?<br><br>

            Holding on to fury, is that all we ever know?<br>
            Ignorance our judge and jury all we've got to show<br>
            From Hollywood to Babylon, holy war to kingdom come<br>
            On a trail of dust and ashes, when the burning sky is done <br>

                You're just too blind to see<br><br>
