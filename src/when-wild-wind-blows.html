       <p>
        Have you heard what they said on the news today?<br>
        Have you heard what is coming to us all?<br>
        That the world as we know it will be coming to an end<br>
        Have you heard? Have you heard?<br><br>

        He sees them in the distance, when the darkened clouds roll<br>
        He could feel tension in the atmosphere<br>
        He would look in the mirror see an old man now<br>
        Does it matter they survive somehow?<br><br>

        They said there's nothing can be done about the situation<br>
        They said there's nothing you can do at all<br>
        To sit and wait around for something to occur<br>
        Did you know? Did you know?
        </p>

            As he stares across the garden looking at the meadows<br>
            And wonders if they'll ever grow again<br>
            The desperation of the situation getting graver<br>
            Getting ready when the wild wind blows<br><br>

            Have you seen what they said on the news today?<br>
            Have you heard what they said about us all?<br>
            Do you know what is happening to just every one of us?<br>
            Have you heard? Have you heard?<br><br>

            There will be a catastrophe the like we've never seen<br>
            There will be something that will light the sky<br>
            That the world as we know it it will never be the same<br>
            Did you know? Did you know?<br>

            He carries everything into the shelter not a fuss<br>
            Getting ready when the moment comes<br>
            He has enough supplies to last them for a year or two<br>
            Good to have because you never know<br><br>

            They tell us nothing that we don't already know about<br>
            They tell us nothing that is real at all<br>
            They only fill us with the stuff that they want<br>
            Did you know? Did you know?<br><br>

            He's nearly finished with the preparations for the day<br>
            He's getting tired that'll do for now<br>
            They are preparing for the very worst to come to them<br>
            Getting ready when the wild wind blows<br>

            He sees the picture on the wall it's falling down<br>
            Upside down<br>
            He sees a teardrop from his wife roll down her face<br>
            Saying Grace<br><br>

            Remember times they had they flash right through his mind<br>
            Left behind<br>
            Of a lifetime spent together long ago<br>
            Will be gone<br><br>

            They've been preparing for some weeks now<br>
            For when the crucial moment comes<br>
            To take their refuge in the shelter<br>
            Let them prepare for what will come<br>

                They make a tea and sit there waiting<br>
                They're in the shelter feeling snug<br>
                Not long to wait for absolution<br>
                Don't make a fuss just sit and wait<br><br>

                Can't believe all the lying<br>
                All the screens are denying<br>
                That the moments of truth have begun<br>
                Can't you see it on the TV?<br>
                Don't believe them in the least bit<br>
                Now the days of our ending have begun<br><br>

                Say a prayer when it's all over<br>
                Survivors unite all as one<br>
                Got to try and help each other<br>
                Got the will to overcome<br>

                When they found them had their arms wrapped around each other<br>
                Their tins of poison laying near by their clothes<br>
                The day they both mistook an earthquake for the fallout<br>
                Just another when the wild wind blows<br>
