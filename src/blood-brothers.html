        <h2>Blood Brothers</h2>

        <p>
            And if you're taking a walk through the garden of life <br>
            What do you think you'd expect you would see?<br>
            Just like a mirror reflecting the moves of your life<br>
            And in the river reflections of me<br><br>

            Just for a second a glimpse of my father I see<br>
            And in a movement he beckons to me<br>
            And in a moment the memories are all that remain<br>
            And all the wounds are reopening again<br><br>

            We're blood brothers<br>
            We're blood brothers<br>
            We're blood brothers<br>
            We're blood brothers<br>
        
        </p>

            And as you look all around at the world in dismay<br>
            What do you see, do you think we have learned?<br>
            Not if you're taking a look at the war-torn affray<br>
            Out in the streets where the babies are burnt<br><br>

            We're blood brothers<br>
            We're blood brothers<br>
            We're blood brothers<br>
            We're blood brothers<br><br>

            There are times when I feel I'm afraid for the world<br>
            There are times I'm ashamed of us all<br>
            When you're floating on all the emotion you feel<br>
            And reflecting the good and the bad<br><br>

            Will we ever know what the answer to life really is?<br>
            Can you really tell me what life is?<br>
            Maybe all the things that you know that are precious to you<br>
            Could be swept away by fate's own hand<br><br>

            We're blood brothers<br>
            We're blood brothers<br>
            We're blood brothers<br>
            We're blood brothers<br><br>

            When you think that we've used all our chances<br>
            And the chance to make everything right<br>
            Keep on making the same old mistakes<br>
            Makes untipping the balance so easy<br>
            When we're living our lives on the edge<br>
            Say a prayer on the book of the dead<br><br>
