        <h2>The Wicker Man</h2>

        <p>
            Hand of fate is moving and the finger points to you <br>
            He knocks you to your feet and so what are you gonna do?<br>
            Your tongue has frozen now you've got something to say<br>
            The piper at the gates of dawn is calling you his way<br><br>
            
            You watch the world exploding every single night<br>
            Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light<br>
            Say goodbye to gravity and say goodbye to death<br>
            Hello to eternity and live for every breath<br><br>
        </p>

            Your time will come<br>
            Your time will come<br>
            Your time will come<br>
            Your time will come<br><br>

            The ferryman wants his money, you ain't going to give it back<br>
            He can push his own boat as you set up off the track<br>
            Nothing you can contemplate will ever be the same<br>
            Every second is a new spark, sets the universe aflame<br><br>

            You watch the world exploding every single night<br>
            Dancing in the sun a newborn in the light<br>
            Brothers and their fathers joining hands and make a chain <br>
            The shadow of the Wicker Man is rising up again<br>
