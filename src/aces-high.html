            There goes the siren that warns of the air raid  <br>
            There comes the sound of the guns sending flak  <br>
            Out for the scramble we've got to get airborne  <br>
            Got to get up for the coming attack  <br> <br>
       </p>
    
     <p>
            Jump in the cockpit and start up the engines  <br>
            Remove all the wheelblocks there's no time to waste  <br>
            Gathering speed as we head down the runway  <br>
            Gotta get airborne before it's too late
