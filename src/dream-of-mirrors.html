        <h2>Dream of Mirrors</h2>
        
       <p>
            Have you ever felt the future is the past <br>
            But you don't know how?<br>
            A reflected dream of a captured time<br>
            Is it really now? Is it really happening?<br><br>

            Don't know why I feel this way<br>
            Have I dreamt this time, this place?<br>
            Something vivid comes again into my mind<br><br>

            And I think I've seen your face<br>
            Seen this room, been in this place<br>
            Something vivid comes again into my mind
        </p>

    <section class="image" id="dream_1">
        <p>
            All my hopes and expectations <br>
            Looking for an explanation<br>
            Have I found my destination?<br>
            I just can't take no more<br><br>
           
            The dream is true, the dream is true<br>
            The dream is true, the dream is true<br><br>

            Think I've heard your voice before<br>
            Think I've said these words before<br>
            Something makes me feel I just might <br>
            Lose my mind

            Am I still inside my dream?<br>
            Is this a new reality?<br>
            Something makes me feel that I have <br>
            Lost my mind <br><br>

            All my hopes and expectations<br>
            Looking for an explanation<br>
            Coming to the realization<br>
            That I can't see for sure<br><br>

            I only dream in black and white<br>
            I only dream 'cause I'm alive<br>
            I only dream in black and white<br>
            To save me from myself (2x)
        </p>

       <section class="image" id="dream_2">

        <p>
            The dream is true, the dream is true<br>
            The dream is true, the dream is true<br><br>

            I get up, put on the light<br>
            Dreading the oncoming night <br>
            Scared to fall asleep and <br> 
            Dream the dream again<br><br>

            Nothing that I contemplate<br>
            Nothing that I can compare <br>
            To letting loose the demons deep <br>
            Inside my head<br><br>

       <section class="normal">
            <p>
                Dread to think what might be stirring<br>
                That my dream is reoccurring<br>
                Got to keep away from drifting<br>
                Saving me from myself <br><br>

                I only dream in black and white<br>
                I only dream 'cause I'm alive<br>
                I only dream in black and white<br>
                To save me from myself (2x)<br><br>

                Lost in a dream of mirrors<br>
                Lost in a paradox<br>
                Lost and time is spinning<br>
                Lost a nightmare I retrace<br><br>

                Lost a hell that I revisit<br>
                Lost another time and place<br>
                Lost a parallel existence<br>
                Lost a nightmare I retrace
