        <h2>Dance of Death</h2>

        <p>
                Let me tell you a story to chill the bones <br>
                About a thing that I saw<br>
                One night wandering in the Everglades<br>
                I'd one drink, but no more<br><br>
        
                I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight<br>
                Gazing up at the stars<br>
                Not aware of a presence so near to me<br>
                Watching my every move<br><br>

                Feeling scared and I fell to my knees<br>
                As something rushed me from the trees<br>
                Took me to an unholy place<br>
                And that is where I fell from grace <br><br>

                Then they summoned me over to join in with them<br>
                To the dance of the dead<br>
                Into the circle of fire, I followed them<br>
                Into the middle I was led<br><br>
        
                As if time had stopped still<br>
                I was numb with fear, but still<br>
                I wanted to go<br>
                And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me<br>
                As I walked onto the coals<br><br>

                And my spirit was lifted from me<br>
                And if only someone had the chance<br>
                To witness what happened to me<br><br>

            And I danced, and I pranced<br>
            And I sang with them<br>
            All had death in their eyes<br>
            Lifeless figures<br>
            They were undead, all of them<br>
            They had ascended from hell<br>
            And I felt I was in a trance <br><br>   

            As I danced with the dead<br>
            My free spirit was laughing<br>
            And howling down at me<br>
            Below my undead body<br>
            Just danced the circle of dead<br><br>
               
            Until the time came to reunite us both<br>
            My spirit came back down to me<br>
            I didn't know if I was alive or dead<br>
            As the others all joined in with me

            By luck then a skirmish started<br>
            And took the attention away from me<br>
            When they took their gaze from me<br>
            Was the moment that I fled<br><br>

            I ran like hell, faster than the wind<br>
            But behind I did not glance<br>
            One thing that I did not dare<br>
            Was to look just straight ahead<br><br>
        
            When you know that your time has come around<br>
            You know you'll be prepared for it<br>
            Say your last goodbyes to everyone<br>
            Have a drink and say a prayer for it<br><br>
               
          </p>

        When you're lying in your sleep<br>
        When you're lying in your bed<br>
        And you wake from your dreams<br>
        To go dancing with the dead<br><br>

        When you're lying in your sleep<br>
        When you're lying in your bed<br>
        And you wake from your dreams<br>
        To go dancing with the dead<br><br>

        To this day I guess I'll never know<br>
        Just why they let me go<br>
        But I'll never go dancing no more<br>
        Till I dance with the dead<br>
