        <h2>Gates of Tomorrow</h2>

        <p>
            Weaving a thread round your heart and your soul <br>
            Deceiving your eyes and delaying your goal <br>
            Ships in the night when they pass out of sight<br>
            Deliver their cargo of earthly delights<br><br>

            To the woman and children, the souls of the dead<br>
            I've opened the book and no mercy is shed<br>
            You want forgiveness and you want it cheap<br>
            I don't give redemption rewards for the meek<br><br>

            Suffering evil when you pay the price of fame<br>
            There isn't a God to save you, if you don't save yourself<br>
            You can't blame a madman for this if you go insane<br>
            Give me the strength so I carry on<br><br>
        
            Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads<br>
            Show you the gates of tomorrow<br>
            Trapped in the web, no mercy is shed<br>
            Show you the gates of tomorrowv<br><br>

            Trapped in the web, slaves to the dead<br>
            Show you the gates of tomorrow<br>
            Trapped in the web, but I cut the threads<br>
            Show you the gates of tomorrow<br><br>
